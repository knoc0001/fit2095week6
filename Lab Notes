Lab Week 6
Improve the To-Do web app that you have developed in week 5 by adding new features:

It uses MongoDB to store all the tasks instead of arrays
Each task has the following fields:
taskID: unique integer number generated by the server
Task name
Assign to (name of the person who will handle it)
Due date (should be in date datatype, not a string)
Task status (either InProgress or Complete)
Task Description
Pages
Insert new task page: adds new document to the DB
Get all tasks page: shows all the tasks in a table format
Delete task by taskID: the page takes a taskID as input and deletes its tasks from the DB
Delete all the completed tasks
Update task status by taskID: the page takes two inputs: a taskID and a new status (either InProgress or Complete). It sets the new status to the task with taskID.
Add a logo for the home page
change the background of all pages using a CSS file
redirect the client to the get all tasks page after the insert, update and delete operations.



    /*
    let query = { dueDate: 'task due' };
    db.collection("taskDB").find(query).toArray(function (err, result) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(result);
    });
    */
